## Git and GitHub

The course from Udemy helped a lot with basic work with git and github. These skills helped me easily complete the first half of the tasks on Learn Git Branching. Now any project\experiment will be started with a git init!

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

It was easy enough to finish the CLI course. The HTTP tutorial briefly describes the basic information, which is excellent as an introduction. It was interesting to learn about persistent connections and cache management through headers.
